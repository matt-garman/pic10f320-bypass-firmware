# Drive the PIC10F320 POWER-ON-PRESSED startup case in gpsim and assert the LED
# (RA0) / footswitch (RA3) at three settled checkpoints. Companion to
# run_gpsim_test.sh (the two-press toggle scenario); this one covers the startup
# branch where the footswitch is held CLOSED at power-on -- the device must come
# up in BYPASS and must NOT engage until a genuine release + a fresh press. The
# gpsim stimulus + register snapshots live in test/pic/power_on_pressed.stc; this
# wrapper runs it against a built HEX, parses the snapshots, and turns them into
# PASS/FAIL. It deliberately mirrors run_gpsim_test.sh's structure.
#
# Usage:
#   run_gpsim_power_on_pressed.sh <hexfile>
#
#   <hexfile>   a built PIC HEX (build_pic/bypass_mcu_pic10f320.hex). Only RA0/RA3
#               are asserted -- identical across every variant (the per-variant
#               output stage drives only RA1/RA2) -- so no per-variant control-pin
#               pattern is needed here.
#
# Exit status: 0 = all checks passed (or gpsim not installed -> skipped); 1 = a
# check failed or gpsim/the HEX could not be run.
#
# Pins (bypass_mcu_pic10f320.c): RA3 = footswitch (1=released, 0=pressed),
# RA0 = status LED (LATA bit0; 1=ENGAGED, 0=BYPASS).
