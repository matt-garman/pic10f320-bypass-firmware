# Drive the PIC10F320 footswitch in gpsim and assert PORTA/LATA at four settled
# checkpoints. The companion script test/pic/footswitch_toggle.stc contains the
# gpsim stimulus + register snapshots; this wrapper runs it against a built HEX,
# parses the snapshots, and turns them into PASS/FAIL.
#
# Usage:
#   run_gpsim_test.sh <hexfile> [expected_engaged_lata_hex]
#
#   <hexfile>                 a built PIC HEX (build_pic/bypass_mcu_pic10f320.hex)
#   expected_engaged_lata_hex optional: the FULL LATA value when ENGAGED for this
#                             variant (cd4053=0x3, mute=0x7, relay=0x1). When
#                             given, it is asserted in addition to the universal
#                             LED-bit checks; when omitted, only the LED bit (RA0)
#                             and footswitch (RA3) behaviour is asserted.
#
# Exit status: 0 = all checks passed (or gpsim not installed -> skipped); 1 = a
# check failed or gpsim/the HEX could not be run.
#
# Pins (bypass_mcu_pic10f320.c): RA3 = footswitch (1=released, 0=pressed),
# RA0 = status LED (LATA bit0; 1=ENGAGED, 0=BYPASS).
