# Firmware line-coverage gate for bypass_mcu_pic10f320.c, driven by the fault +
# happy-path harness (test/fault). Unlike the model coverage gate (a percentage
# floor), this asserts an EXACT property: every firmware line must be covered
# EXCEPT the watchdog-reset fault path, which is uncoverable on the host for two
# documented reasons --
#
#   - hw_force_wdt_reset()'s body deliberately never returns (for (;;) {}). gcov's
#     edge-flow solver cannot credit the lines of a function with no exit, so they
#     read as uncovered even though the harness DOES drive them (fw_fault_run
#     proves the path is taken: the firmware has to be timed out of the spin).
#   - the switch's `default:` case is unreachable while the sanity gate is intact
#     (the gate rejects any out-of-range program_state BEFORE the switch). It is
#     defense-in-depth; the model's equivalent default IS formally proven
#     (test/formal: prove_corrupt_state_faults / verify_corrupt_state_faults).
#
# So those specific lines are allow-listed by their EXACT SOURCE TEXT (robust to
# line renumbering): the `hw_force_wdt_reset()` DEFINITION line, its body
# (`INTCONbits.GIE = 0;`, `for (;;) { }`), the unreachable `default:` label, and
# the `hw_force_wdt_reset();` call statement. gcov's edge-flow solver credits a
# no-exit function poorly, so it marks even the function's signature/opening-brace
# line as uncovered (the harness DOES enter it -- fw_fault_run proves the spin is
# reached -- but the line still reads `#####`); that line is therefore allow-listed
# too. This is deliberately a tight, enumerated list -- NOT a `*hw_force_wdt_reset*`
# wildcard -- so a comment or some future construct that merely mentions the
# function can never be silently waved through. Any OTHER uncovered firmware line
# fails the gate -- that is the regression alarm: a real piece of firmware logic
# lost its test.
#
# Note on the `hw_force_wdt_reset();` text: it appears at TWO call sites -- the
# unreachable `default:` case (legitimately uncovered) AND the live sanity-gate in
# main() (which MUST be covered). They are textually identical, so this allow-list
# necessarily permits both; it cannot, by text alone, tell a regression in the
# live call site apart from the dead one. That is acceptable because the live
# call's coverage is guaranteed INDEPENDENTLY and loudly by test/fault: its eight
# `expect_reset(...)` cases all route through that exact statement, so if it ever
# went uncovered the fault test would fail long before this gate could mask it.
#
