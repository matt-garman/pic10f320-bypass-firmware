# Mutation testing for the PIC10F320 bypass firmware + its reference model.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   A passing suite proves the tests pass on correct code; it does not prove they
#   FAIL on broken code. Mutation testing closes that gap: it injects a small,
#   deliberate fault ("mutant") into a production source, rebuilds, and runs a
#   fast test target. An adequate suite must DETECT the fault -- the target must
#   FAIL (the mutant is "killed"). A surviving mutant marks a real hole.
#
# WHAT IS MUTATED, AND WHAT KILLS IT
#   - The firmware (bypass_mcu_pic10f320.c): killed by `make test-equiv` (the
#     firmware<->model trace comparison) and/or `make test-gpsim` (the real HEX in
#     gpsim). These are the oracles that watch the SHIPPING code.
#   - The reference model (test/model/bypass_pure.c) and the model thresholds:
#     killed by `make test-host` / `make test-model-check` (logic), or by
#     `make test-equiv` (a model-threshold change diverges from the firmware).
#
# This runs on a throwaway COPY of the tree; it never modifies the real sources.
# Wired into `make test-mutation`; intentionally NOT part of `make test` (it
# rebuilds per mutant). Each mutant lists the fast target expected to kill it.

# --- firmware: GPIO / footswitch wiring -------------------------------------------

# redundant oracle via the functional scenarios (footswitch_toggle.stc), just not
# the mutation-kill target. This leaves the tick-cadence mutant below as the sole
# genuinely gpsim-only kill -- matching the README's "one deliberate exception".
# The CD4053 control mis-route does NOT move RA0 (it is on RA1), so it is the one

# test-actuation/test-fault are blind to it by construction; the real TMR2 in gpsim
# is the only oracle, caught by footswitch_toggle.stc's mid-debounce PRESS1_EARLY
# checkpoint (LED must still be OFF ~3.5 ms into the press). This is the deliberate
